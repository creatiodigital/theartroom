/**
 * Reads a published exhibition for the public profile page. Returns

 * a 404 at the route boundary.
 *
 * Mirrors the snapshot reconciliation done in /api/exhibitions/by-url:
 * when an exhibition has a `publishedSnapshot`, the curated artwork set
 * comes from the snapshot, then each artwork is enriched with live DB
 * metadata so edits to title/dimensions/etc. show up without a republish.
 * 3D scene fields in the snapshot are not part of this profile shape —
 * they're only consumed by the /visit route.
