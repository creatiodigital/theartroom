/**
 * Shared renderer for the flat wayfinding signs mounted on the gallery walls —
 * `ExitSign` and `ContinueSign`. They differ only in artwork and node name, so
 * the material handling lives here once: the flipY correction and the unlit
 * setup below are subtle enough that two copies would eventually drift.
 *
 * Geometry and placement come from the space's GLB; only the material is
 * applied here, matching how walls, floors and ceilings are handled — the GLB
 * is exported with materials off.
 *
 * Size lives in the GLB by design, which means the sign quad and the artwork
 * must share an aspect ratio — the texture is stretched to fill the quad, so a
 * mismatch shows up as a squashed sign. Author the quad to match whatever the
 * PNG is exported at, in each space's GLB.
