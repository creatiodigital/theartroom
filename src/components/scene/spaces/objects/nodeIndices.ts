 * How many of each prop a space has is a property of the MODEL, not of the code.

 * told the count by hand (`<TrackLamp count={14} />`), which meant a space with
 * more props silently rendered only the first N and the rest were invisible with
 * no error. Reading the count off the model instead means a bigger space needs no
 * code change at all.
 *
 * Matching is anchored (`^prefix\d+$`) rather than `startsWith`, because prop
 * families share prefixes: `trackLampBody` and `trackLampBulb` both begin with
 * `trackLampB`, and a loose match would conflate them.

 * a page load sees the authored parents; every later mount sees `parent === null`
 * and silently buckets every lamp into one anonymous group.
 *
 * That failure is invisible and expensive: the lighting panel loses its per-room
 * sections, and `useActiveRoom` sees `groups.length <= 1`, decides the space has
 * no rooms, and stops culling — so a two-room space quietly runs every light in
 * the building.

 * WeakMap, it dies with the GLTF cache entry. A collapsed result is deliberately
 * NOT cached: a genuinely ungrouped space (Paris, Madrid) simply recomputes a
 * short loop each time, and a space whose parents were already destroyed keeps

 * on Save & close, parked it out in the void with it.
