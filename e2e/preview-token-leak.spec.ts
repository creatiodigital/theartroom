/**
 * `previewToken` is a credential, not metadata.
 *
 * It is the single secret that unlocks an UNPUBLISHED show: hand someone
 * `?preview=<token>` and they see a work-in-progress exhibition that the artist
 * has not announced. `api/exhibitions/[id]/route.ts` strips it before returning,
 * with the comment "must never be returned to anyone else" — and asserts that
 * the public visit path applies the same gate.
 *
 * It did not. `getExhibition()` used `include` with no `select`/`omit`, so every
 * Exhibition scalar materialised, and both response paths spread it verbatim.
 * A plain anonymous GET of any published show returned a live, working token.
 *
 * That matters after the fact, not just during the draft: publishing never
 * clears the token, so a token scraped while a show was public keeps working if
 * the show is later unpublished — the owner believes it is offline and it is not.
 *
 * The second test is the positive control. Omitting a field is easy; omitting it
 * without breaking the feature it belongs to is the actual job. If the preview
 * gate stops honouring a valid token, that test fails and this one still passes,
 * which is exactly the pair of signals worth having.
