/**
 * The sale block on an artwork card — edition tag, price, "Order Print".
 *
 * /prints could get away with a grid-level `withOrderPrint` flag because its
 * query had already filtered the list down to purchasable work: every card was
 * for sale, so "no price" could only mean sold out. The artist and exhibition
 * grids hold everything an artist made, sellable or not, and on a mixed grid
 * that shortcut stamps "Sold out" on work that was never for sale.
 *
 * So the decision moves onto the card, and `resolveArtworkSale` is the one
 * place that makes it. Three outcomes, and telling them apart is the whole job:
 *
 *   null                    — not for sale; the card shows no commerce at all
 *   { minPriceCents: n }    — on sale at n
 *   { minPriceCents: null }  — live, but nothing left to buy → "Sold out"
 *
 * Calls the resolver and the page queries directly — no browser, no WebGL.
